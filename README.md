# CS50 Problem Sets — My Archive

**⚠️ Disclaimer**  
These are my personal solutions to CS50 problem sets that I completed many years ago. If you are currently taking CS50, **please do not copy** these. Use them only as a reference or for learning.

## About

This repository contains my solutions to various CS50 problem sets from the year I took the course. I’ve structured it so you can see how I approached each problem, but keep in mind:

- These were written at a much earlier stage in my learning.
- Some solutions may be flawed or inefficient.
- The purpose is archival / learning, not to serve as “best” answers.
